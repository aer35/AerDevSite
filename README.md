## How to run

Dear Aaron,  
Did you forget how to run the site locally again?  
`npm run dev`  
It's that simple.

Did you forget how to build the site for publishing?  
`npm run build`  
It's that simple.
NOTE: Committing will run the build for you.

Running `npm update` has a tendency to break things. Maybe don't. ðŸ™‚

Please stop forgetting things.

Sincerely,  
Smarter Better Aaron
